# Tarana Khanna

Full-Stack Developer

I build web applications end-to-end — from user interfaces to server logic and databases.  
I enjoy designing clean APIs, implementing authentication, and then connecting them to responsive frontend interfaces. I’m especially interested in understanding how real production systems are structured and how frontend and backend communicate efficiently.

## Tech Stack
**Frontend**
- React.js
- HTML
- CSS / Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- TypeScript

**Backend**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- REST APIs
- MongoDB
- Postgres
- JWT Authentication
- Middleware & Error Handling

**Tools**
- Git & GitHub
- API Integration
- Postman
- Debugging & Testing

## Experience
Worked as a Full-Stack Developer Intern where I contributed to an existing codebase, collaborated with a team, and followed practices like version control and code reviews. This gave me exposure to real-world development workflows, debugging, and integrating frontend with backend services.

## What I’m Currently Improving
- Writing scalable backend architecture
- API security and validation
- Deployment and production readiness
